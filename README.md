# Pre-work - *Tipper 🤑*

**Tipper** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Ashley Acevedo**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [✔] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [✔] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [✔️] Played with color,typeface, and font size

## Notes

One of the challenges I faced was manipulating the input text field font size. The changes in font size was visible in the storyboard, but didn't show up in the simulator. Eventually, I found a solution I was happy with, and even picked up on additional knowledge along the way.
